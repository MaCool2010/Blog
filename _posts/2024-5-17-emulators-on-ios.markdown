Apple recently started allowing emulators into the IOS App Store. Theres a full list of emulators [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/EmulationOniOS/comments/1c5kxyo/available_ios_emulators_megathread/)

Here are some of my favorites.

  

## Delta

Delta has a great user experience, and is easy to use. It plays NES-N64 and Gameboy-DS. 
Install Delta [here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/delta-game-emulator/id1048524688)

## PPSSPP

Probably my favorite emulator on IOS, PPSSPP is a great PlayStation Portable emulator. It works well and is really customizable. 
Install PPSSPP [here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ppsspp-psp-emulator/id6496972903)

## RetroArch

The most capable and hardest to use emulator that I have ever used. RetroArch is a powerful emulator frontend that supports most game systems. It is also customizable and it can be great. But the it take awhile to learn how to setup and use it. Especially compared to Delta and PPSSPP. The positive is that you can pretty much do anything with RetroArch.
