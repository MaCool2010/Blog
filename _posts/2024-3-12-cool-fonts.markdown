Fonts are cool, so here are some of my favorites.

[Silkscreen](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Silkscreen) - Silkscreen is the best pixel font I've found. It has a great bold form, and its pixels are even.

[Bungee Shade](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bungee+Shade) - This font is great, it has a great 3d effect to it. It's one of my favorite fonts, I even used it for the header of pages on my website.

[Bungee](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bungee) - Bungee is a good font on its own, but it goes great with Bungee Shade.

[Source Code Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Code+Pro) - This is my one of my favorite monospace fonts, and I use it a lot when I need to show code.

[JetBrains Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/JetBrains+Mono) - One of the best monospace fonts I've ever seen. I use it on my terminal and on my website. I love it so much.
